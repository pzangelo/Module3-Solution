                <h2>Chicken</h2>
There was once a big farm near a vast field, and here there lived a hen named Penny. She was great friends with everyone, and those who knew her gave her many names.
She was a tiny hen. The other chickens in the yard would tease her for her size. They often termed her “Chicken Little.” While Penny surprisingly loved this name, her favorite thing to be 
called was “Henny-Penny,” given to her by the other fowls that lived nearby. The rhyme was perfect, it was sweet, and she liked it very much.
One morning, as Henny-Penny was plucking worms in the henyard, an acorn dropped from a tree right onto her head! She had no idea what had hit her, however, and so she started shouting:

the fowl friends“The sky is falling! The sky is falling!”
She ran around in circles for a while, calmed herself, and then got right to waddling—she had to alert the king!
She waddled and waddled and waddled until she found her excellent friend Rooster-Booster.
“What is the matter, Henny-Penny?” he asked.
“Oh, Rooster-Booster, the sky is falling! The sky is falling! And we must alert the king!” she cried.
“Oh, we must, we must!” he cried back.
Henny-Penny and Rooster-Booster waddled and waddled and waddled until they saw their wonderful pal Ducky-Chucky.
Now, Ducky-Chucky was basking in the sun near the pond is edge when he noticed the two chickens fast-approaching.
